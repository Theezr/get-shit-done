# Executor Checkpoint Protocol

These sections apply when the plan has `autonomous: false` (contains checkpoint tasks).

<authentication_gates>
**Auth errors during `type="auto"` execution are gates, not failures.**

**Indicators:** "Not authenticated", "Not logged in", "Unauthorized", "401", "403", "Please run {tool} login", "Set {ENV_VAR}"

**Protocol:**
1. Recognize it's an auth gate (not a bug)
2. STOP current task
3. Return checkpoint with type `human-action` (use checkpoint_return_format)
4. Provide exact auth steps (CLI commands, where to get keys)
5. Specify verification command

**In Summary:** Document auth gates as normal flow, not deviations.
</authentication_gates>

<checkpoint_protocol>

**CRITICAL: Automation before verification**

Before any `checkpoint:human-verify`, ensure verification environment is ready. If plan lacks server startup before checkpoint, ADD ONE (deviation Rule 3).

For full automation-first patterns, server lifecycle, CLI handling:
**See @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md**

**Quick reference:** Users NEVER run CLI commands. Users ONLY visit URLs, click UI, evaluate visuals, provide secrets. Claude does all automation.

---

When encountering `type="checkpoint:*"`: **STOP immediately.** Return structured checkpoint message using checkpoint_return_format.

**checkpoint:human-verify (90%)** — Visual/functional verification after automation.
Provide: what was built, exact verification steps (URLs, commands, expected behavior).

**checkpoint:decision (9%)** — Implementation choice needed.
Provide: decision context, options table (pros/cons), selection prompt.

**checkpoint:human-action (1% - rare)** — Truly unavoidable manual step (email link, 2FA code).
Provide: what automation was attempted, single manual step needed, verification command.

</checkpoint_protocol>

<checkpoint_return_format>
When hitting checkpoint or auth gate, return this structure:

```markdown
## CHECKPOINT REACHED

**Type:** [human-verify | decision | human-action]
**Plan:** {phase}-{plan}
**Progress:** {completed}/{total} tasks complete

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Name        | Commit | Files                        |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | [task name] | [hash] | [key files created/modified] |

### Current Task

**Task {N}:** [task name]
**Status:** [blocked | awaiting verification | awaiting decision]
**Blocked by:** [specific blocker]

### Checkpoint Details

[Type-specific content]

### Awaiting

[What user needs to do/provide]
```

Completed Tasks table gives continuation agent context. Commit hashes verify work was committed. Current Task provides precise continuation point.
</checkpoint_return_format>

<continuation_handling>
If spawned as continuation agent (`<completed_tasks>` in prompt):

1. Verify previous commits exist: `git log --oneline -5`
2. DO NOT redo completed tasks
3. Start from resume point in prompt
4. Handle based on checkpoint type: after human-action → verify it worked; after human-verify → continue; after decision → implement selected option
5. If another checkpoint hit → return with ALL completed tasks (previous + new)
</continuation_handling>
