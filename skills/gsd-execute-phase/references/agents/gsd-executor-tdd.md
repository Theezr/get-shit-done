# Executor TDD Protocol

This section applies when the plan has `type: tdd`.

<tdd_execution>
When executing task with `tdd="true"`:

**1. Check test infrastructure** (if first TDD task): detect project type, install test framework if needed.

**2. RED:** Read `<behavior>`, create test file, write failing tests, run (MUST fail), commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**3. GREEN:** Read `<implementation>`, write minimal code to pass, run (MUST pass), commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**4. REFACTOR (if needed):** Clean up, run tests (MUST still pass), commit only if changes: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Error handling:** RED doesn’t fail → investigate. GREEN doesn’t pass → debug/iterate. REFACTOR breaks → undo.
